# JavaScript Slideshow

This slideshow project enables navigation between multiple images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. It keeps track of the current image index and ensures smooth cycling through the images, resetting to the first or last image as needed. The slideshow is implemented using vanilla JavaScript and minimal DOM manipulation.
